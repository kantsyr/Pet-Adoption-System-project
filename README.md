## 📋 Project Overview

Pet adoption platform designed to streamline the process of connecting homeless animals with caring adopters. Our system facilitates the entire adoption journey while supporting shelter operations, medical tracking, and multi-user coordination.

### 🌟 Key Features
- **Multi-role user management** (Admin, Shelter Staff, Adopters, Veterinarians)
- **Complete animal profiling** with medical history and behavioral assessments
- **Digital adoption process** from application to contract
- **Medical record tracking** and vaccination management
- **Shelter capacity management** and occupancy tracking
- **Sustainability-focused operations**
